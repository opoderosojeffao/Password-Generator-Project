# Password Generator

A Password Generator Project in Java with GUI.

## Description

* This project is my first program made from scratch (without any course/tutorial).

* A password generator with GUI using Java. It can generate passwords from 8 to 32 characters based on user preferences and if it consists of numbers, special characters, or both. Also, it shows an "error" message if the user enters a number different from 8 to 32 or if the user tries to write letters instead of numbers in the length field.

## Help

Since this is my first project uploaded to GitHub, I would appreciate any help/tips and problems found in the code.
